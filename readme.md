## What's included
* pug template
* typescript
* firebase
* sass

## Why start
Whenever I start a small project , I used to struggle with setting up a dev-envirionment and start with building authentication system. 
I felt It's a boring work and useless. 
So I want to save a time. 

with this template,
I want you to save a time and only focus on enjoying development.
